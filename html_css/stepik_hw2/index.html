				Beneath the flashy homepages of your favorite sites lurk Hooli™ and other evil corporations out to hoard and sell your most personal data.<br><br>
				What was built to be the ultimate platform for the free sharing of knowledge has turned into a money-hungry monster feasting on our privacy and freedom.<br><br> 
				But fear not, for Pied Piper has the answer! And it’s simple:<br>
				An autonomous peer-to-peer network featuring distributed storage powered by universal compression, accelerated scheduling allocation, and end-to-end encryption.<br><br>
				Put even simpler — <strong>it’s the internet, completely decentralized.</strong>
